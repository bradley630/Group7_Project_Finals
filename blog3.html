                    <br>
                    <p>Several surveys and research have identified Python, JavaScript, and Java as the
                        top programming languages. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at each of these languages to
                        see what distinguishes them and how they differ.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Python is one of the most widely used programming languages. It is really simple to use and
                        clutter-free.</p>
                    <p>Python is the most desired programming language of the year, according to a 2019 Stackoverflow
                        survey of developers. This isn’t surprising, given Python’s reputation as a developer-friendly
                        language.</p>

                    <h1>How Does Python Code Look?</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Let’s write some code to get a better understanding of Python’s syntax. Let’s develop a simple
                        program to determine whether the number entered by the user is odd or even.</p>
                    <p class="bg-light px-4 py-4">num = int(input("Enter a number to check if odd or even: "))
                        if (num % 2) == 0:<br>
                        print("{0} is Even".format(num))<br>
                        else:<br>
                        print("{0} is Odd".format(num))</p>
                    <p>If you’re unfamiliar with Python, you’ll note that its syntax is somewhat different from those of
                        other programming languages. Curly braces, classes, and public/private modifiers are all absent.
                        It’s quite straightforward and clutter-free. One of the reasons Python is so popular among
                        programmers is because of this. Let’s take a look at the output of the above program.</p>
                    <p class="bg-light px-4 py-4">Enter a number to check if odd or even: 56<br>
                        56<br>
                        56 is Even</p>
                    <p>Here’s a quick rundown of why Python is one of today’s most popular programming languages.</p>
                    <li>Simple to use.</li>
                    <li>Free of clutter in code.</li>
                    <li>Easy to learn for beginners of programming.</li>
                    <li>Best suited for machine learning, AI projects and research.</li>
                    <li>Follows Object Oriented Paradigms.</li>
                    <li>Can be used to build frontend and backend applications.</li>
                    <li>Extensively used by data scientists.</li>
                    <li>Huge community support.</li>

                    <h1>why Python?</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Python is a popular and developer-friendly programming language, yet every programming language
                        has flaws. Here’s a list of reasons why Python might not be the best choice.</p>
                    <li>Python is rarely used for mobile development due to the availability of various frameworks such
                        as React Native and Flutter, as well as native languages such as Swift and Java. As a result,
                        you won’t find any Python-based mobile apps.</li>
                    <li>Other programming languages are difficult to learn if Python is your first language. You may
                        fall in love with its simplicity and find it difficult to learn other programming languages.
                        When migrating from Python to another programming language, such as Java, it may appear
                        complicated.</li>
                    <li>Python isn’t widely utilized in large-scale software development — Python isn’t widely used in
                        enterprise software development in major corporations. In comparison, languages like Java and
                        JavaScript are utilized more frequently. Python is slower at runtime and has database access
                        limits. Python’s database access layer is inferior to JDBC or ODBC, making it unsuitable for
                        large-scale applications.</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>Let’s recreate the Python application we created earlier in Java. The application verifies
                        whether the number entered by the user is odd or even.</p>
                    <p class="bg-light px-4 py-4">import java.util.Scanner;<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public class EvenOdd {<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);<br>
                        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");<br>
                        int num = reader.nextInt();<br>
                        if(num % 2 == 0)<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.println(num + " is even");<br>
                        else<br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.println(num + " is odd");<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
                        }</p>
                    <p>It’s worth noting that the syntax is completely different from Python’s. We’ve covered topics
                        like class, public/private access, scanner, and more. In comparison to languages like Python,
                        Java programs are more organized. In Java, everything must be contained within a class or
                        interface.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12 intro mx-auto ">
                    <h1>Why Java?</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Here’s a brief overview on why you should learn Java:</p>
                    <li>Java is used in enterprise software applications — One of the main reasons to learn Java is that
                        it is used to construct large-scale apps in many tech businesses around the world. Java is used
                        in the tech stacks of top firms such as Uber, Airbnb, Twitter, and many others. As a result,
                        obtaining work as a Java developer is pretty simple.</li>
                    <li>Performance — Java apps are faster than dynamically typed languages because they are optimized
                        for performance. The JVMs have been upgraded and are fast, making it ideal for huge projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>Android Development — Java is used in the development of native Android applications. If you
                        want to work as a mobile developer who focuses on creating native Android apps, knowing Java is
                        a good idea.</li>
                    <li>Huge Community — Java has been a popular programming language for more than a decade, and it has
                        a sizable community behind it. When you first start learning Java, you’ll come across a plethora
                        of tools, forums, and books to assist you.</li>
                    <li>Platform and Tools — The Java ecosystem has changed over time, and there are now a variety of
                        amazing tools and IDEs that assist Java development, such as IntelliJ, Eclipse, and others.</li>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 intro mx-auto ">
                    <h1>Why not Java?</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Let’s have a look at why Java isn’t an option.</p>
                    <li>Verbose Code — Java code is quite verbose, which can be confusing to a new programmer. This
                        indicates that the code has a lot of boilerplate, which some developers may find tedious. You
                        can see how verbose Java is by comparing the code snippets from our example above.</li>
                    <li>Older Language — Alternatives to Java are increasingly popular among newer developers and
                        startups. This is because it is an older programming language, and they would rather learn a
                        newer, cutting-edge programming language. If you want to work for startups or with cutting-edge
                        technology, you might wish to learn a new programming language.

                    <li>Both Frontend and Backend Development —It’s worth noting that, while JavaScript dominates the
                        frontend development scene, it’s also actively used in backend development with frameworks like
                        Node.js. This means that you can be a frontend and backend developer with contemporary
                        JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>Speed — JavaScript app runs fast Because all of the code runs on the client-side.</li>

                    <h1>Why not JavaScript?</h1>
                    <li>Rapidly Changing: Depending on how you look at it, this might be a pro or a con. JavaScript and
                        its frameworks are fast-changing, and JavaScript today is way different than what it was three
                        years ago. The fact that it is always changing implies that it has a lot of momentum and
                        community involvement. It can, however, be difficult to keep up with.</li>
                    <li>Security Concerns: On the client-side, JavaScript code is performed, and the code is normally
                        exposed. As a result, if best practices are not followed during development, security breaches
                        may occur.</li>
